def create_sharpe_ratio(returns, periods=252):
    """
    Create the Sharpe ratio for the strategy, based on a
    benchmark of zero (i.e. no risk-free rate information).

    Parameters:
    returns - A pandas Series representing period percentage returns.
    periods - Daily (252), Hourly (252*6.5), Minutely(252*6.5*60) etc.

def create_drawdowns(returns):
    """
    Calculate the largest peak-to-trough drawdown of the equity curve
    as well as the duration of the drawdown. Requires that the
    pnl_returns is a pandas Series.

    Parameters:
    equity - A pandas Series representing period percentage returns.

    Returns:
    drawdown, drawdown_max, duration
